If you're interested in learning new languages, it's important to be able to speak with a good accent, to understand speeches or discussions, read books but also to have enough vocabulary.  
My English is not as fluent as it used to be, but i've decided to work on it. So the question : is how many words in a foreign language you need to know ? Well, [the CEFR English levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) can provide the beginning of an answer :

| Levels  | Description   | Nb words   | %   |
|---|---|---|---|
|A1| Beginner | 0-2000 | >80% |
|A2| Elementary | 2000-2750 | |
|B1| Intermediate | 2750–3250  | 95% |
|B2| Upper-Intermediate| 3250–3750 | |
|C1| Advanced | 3750–4500 | |
|C2| Proficiency | 4500–5000  | 98% |

*CEFR English levels are used by all modern English language books and English language schools. It is recommended to use CEFR levels in job resumes (curriculum vitae, CV, Europass CV) and other English level references.*

An article from BBC.com intitled "[How many words do you need to speak a language?](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44569277)" can bring other explanations on the table : 
"*[...] it is incredibly difficult for a language learner to ever know as many words as a native speaker.   
Typically native speakers know 15,000 to 20,000 word families - or lemmas - in their first language.*

*[...] So does someone who can hold a decent conversation in a second language know 15,000 to 20,000 words? Is this a realistic goal for our listener to aim for? Unlikely.*   

*Prof Webb found that people who have been studying languages in a traditional setting - say French in Britain or English in Japan - often struggle to learn more than 2,000 to 3,000 words, even after years of study.*  

*In fact, a study in Taiwan showed that after nine years of learning a foreign language half of the students failed to learn the most frequently-used 1,000 words.*   

*And that is the key, the frequency with which the words you learn appear in day-to-day use in the language you're learning.*   

*You don't need to know all of the words in a language [...]*   

*So which words should we learn? Prof Webb says the most effective way to be able to speak a language quickly is to pick the 800 to 1,000 lemmas which appear most frequently in a language, and learn those.*   

*If you learn only 800 of the most frequently-used lemmas in English, you'll be able to understand 75% of the language as it is spoken in normal life.*"

By searching the web for the most frequently used words, you can quickly arrive on the [OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/wordlists/oxford3000-5000) webpage :

*The Oxford 5000 is an expanded core word list for advanced learners of English. ... the frequency of the words in the Oxford English Corpus, a database of over 2 billion words from different subject areas and contexts which covers British, American and world English.*

... and it could be very interesting to scrape all those words, translate them, and put all of it in an [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck to memorize all this good stuff !

# Download the list of all words

First things first, let's grab [the word list of Oxford 3000 and 5000](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/wordlists/oxford3000-5000). This part of the script provides different user agent in order to not get rapidly flagged as a bot, and a function to retrieve a specific web page by its URL with the help of the __requests__ module :

    ]


def retrieve_webpage(req_url):
    """Get a webpage with the requests module & return the response"""
    try:
        req_response = requests.get(req_url, headers=user_agents[randint(0, len(user_agents))])
        req_response.raise_for_status()
    except HTTPError as http_err:
        print(f'HTTP error occurred: {http_err} for URL {req_url}')
        return None
    except Exception as err:
        print(f'Other error occurred: {err} for URL {req_url}')
        return None
    else:
        # print('Request success!')
        return req_response
    
    
time.sleep(2.4) # in sec
url_wordlist = "https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/wordlists/oxford3000-5000"
req_response = retrieve_webpage(url_wordlist)

if not req_response :
    print("fail")
elif str(req_response) == '<Response [200]>':
    print("success")
else:
    print("something wrong")
```

Then, we'll use Beautifulsoup to parse the html page and retrieve the data we need : the word itself, its phonetic pronunciation, its CEFR level, the url of the web page describing each word, the type (verb, noun...) and the american sound (an .mp3 file).  

In order to achieve this goal, it's required to dive deep in the CSS code of the page, to analyze the nested class and their parameters. For instance, in the dev tools of your browser, by clicking on a specific word on the left, you'll see hightlighted the line of the code where the corresponding text can be found.

```python
s = BeautifulSoup(req_response.content, 'html.parser')
all_elts = s.find_all("li")[34:-44]
words, levels, def_urls, types, sound_urls = [], [], [], [], []

for i in all_elts:
    i = str(i)
    if "data-hw" in i:
        words.append(i.split('data-hw="')[1].split('"')[0])
    else:
        words.append("No word")
    if "data-ox5000" in i:
        levels.append(i.split('data-ox5000="')[1].split('"')[0])
    else:
        levels.append("No level")
    if "href" in i:
        def_urls.append(i.split('href="')[1].split('"')[0])
    else:
        def_urls.append("No def_url")
    if 'class="pos' in i:
        types.append(i.split('class="pos">')[1].split('<')[0])
    else:

    else:
        sound_urls.append("No sound url")


df = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(words, levels, def_urls, types, sound_urls)), columns =['words', 'levels', 'def_urls', 'types', 'sound_urls'])
df.to_csv('words_list', index=False)

There isn't any null data in our pandas dataframe, so it seems that we have retrieved all the infos we were looking for...


```python
df.info()
```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 5948 entries, 0 to 5947
    Data columns (total 5 columns):
     #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype

     4   sound_urls  5948 non-null   object
    dtypes: object(5)
    memory usage: 232.5+ KB
    

Anyway some levels are filled with the default values, but not so many lines are concerned :


```python
df[df['levels'] == 'No level']
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {

Let's insert the corresponding value :


```python
df.loc[df[df['levels'] == 'No level'].index, 'levels'] = 'a1'
df[df['sound_urls'] == 'No sound url']
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>words</th>
      <th>levels</th>
      <th>def_urls</th>
      <th>types</th>
      <th>sound_urls</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>3559</th>
      <td>nursing</td>
      <td>b2</td>
      <td>/definition/english/nursing</td>
      <td>noun</td>
      <td>No sound url</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



Furthermore, there isn't any duplicated line in our dataframe:


```python
df[df.duplicated()].shape[0]
```




    0



# Data cleaning & transformation

We concatenate the relative path with the base url to get the full link. We can also format the level, change a little bit the word type and so on...


```python
BASE_URL = "https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com"

df['def_urls'] = df['def_urls'].apply(lambda x: BASE_URL + x)
df['levels'] = df['levels'].apply(lambda x: x.upper())
df['types'] = df['types'].apply(lambda x: "(" + x + ")")
df['sound_urls'] = df['sound_urls'].apply(lambda x: BASE_URL + x)
df['sound_files'] = df['sound_urls'].apply(lambda x: x.split("/")[-1])
df.head()
```

# Retrieve the sound files

This can be done with a python script or using few shell commands like the ones below:


```python
!mkdir sounds
```


```python
with open("./sounds" + "/" + "url_list.txt", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write("\n".join(set(df['sound_urls'])))
```


```python
!cd sounds, wget -i url_list.txt
```

# Final step : scraping of all the web pages

Now, we'll loop over the wordlist, and for each element, we use the previous function to retrieve the webpage of the word definition. The beautifulsoup part is more tedious, because it's not so easy to find the relevant infos. Here, several tries and errors are mandatory. Imho, using a jupyternotebook is more convenient.


```python
def get_data(resp):
    """Parse HTTP response of a single webpage with BS4 and return relevant data"""
    soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.content, 'html.parser')
    try:
        phonetic = soup.find_all("div", class_="phons_n_am")[0].find_all("span", class_="phon")[0].contents[0]
    except:
        pass
    try:
        senses = soup.find_all("li", class_="sense")
    except:
        pass
    try:
        definitions = [se.find_all(class_="def")[0].contents[0] for se in senses]
        definitions = [f"{i+1}. {def_.replace(';', ',')}" for i, def_ in enumerate(definitions)]
    except:
        pass
    
    try:
        examples = [] # a list of (list of examples for one definition)
        for se in senses:
            all_examples = se.find_all("ul", class_="examples")[0].find_all(htag="li")
            try:
                all_examples = [e.contents[0].text for e in all_examples]
            except:
                try:
                    all_examples = [ex.find_all(class_="x")[0].text for ex in all_ex]
                except:
                    pass
            examples.append("".join(["<dd>- " + e.replace(';', ',') + "<br>" for e in all_examples ]))
    except:
        pass
    return phonetic, definitions, examples

df_test = df.iloc[:20]

# Conclusion

The final python script and the csv files are available in [my Github repository dedicated to scraping stuff](https://github.com/obrunet/Web_Scraping_Projects/tree/master/2020-12-15-Oxford-most-freq-words).   
This little project is a good example of scraping static webpage. Don't forget that Beautifulsoup is not suited when it comes to deal will pages including embedded javascript. In an other post, i'll share tips and code built upon the selenium package able to translate automatically those words. And finally, i'll show you how to use a csv file to create an anki deck that you can freely use to memorize all this vocabulary.
