# Short Introduction

__If you're in a hurry...__

Proposed by [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/tic-heap-cirta-particle-classification-challenge)

In this challenge we want to build a machine learning model to help us recognize particles. Particles are the tiny constituant of matter generated in a collision between proton bunches at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. 

Particles are of course of different types and identifying which particle was produced in an extremly important task for particle physicists. 

Our dataset comprises 350 independent simulated events, where each event contains labelled images of particle trajectories. 

A good model assigns the correct particle type to any particle, even the least frequent ones.

Read throught this notebook to discover more about the particles.

# Longer Introduction

__With in depth explanations if you have more time :)__

This challenge is part of an effort to explore the use of machine learning to assist high energy physicists in discovering and characterizing new particles.

Particles are the tiny constituents of matter generated in a collision between proton bunches. Physicists at CERN study particles using [particle accelerators](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/how-accelerator-works). [The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) is the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator and is used to accelerate and collide protons as well as heavy lead ions. The LHC consists of a 27-kilometre ring of superconducting magnets with a number of accelerating structures to boost the energy of the particles along the way.

In the LHC, proton bunches (beams) circulates and collide at high energy. Each beam collision (also called an event) produces a firework of new particles. To identify the types of these particles, a complex apparatus, the detector records the small energy deposited by the particles when they impact well-defined locations in the detector.

Particle Identification (PID) is fundamental to particle physics experiments. Currently no machine learning solution exists for PID.

The goal of this challenge is to build a machine learning model to read images of particles and identify their type.

This challenge was provided by Sabrina Amrouche and Dalila Salamani who are researchers at CERN and are hosting a session on machine learning at the 10th Conference on High Energy and Astro Particles.

__About the Tenth International Conference on High Energy and Astro Particles ([event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/776520/))__

This Tenth edition of the International Conference on High Energy and Astroparticle Physics (TIC-HEAP) will be held at Mentouri University, Constantine in Algeria during the period of 19th-21st October 2019. Held in close coordination with the DGRSDT (The Algerian General Direction of Scientific Research), it will focus on discussing the latest development on particle physics, astroparticle and cosmology, as well as strategically planning for Algeria to become an active participating member of the CERN.

# The Data Set

The training dataset comprises of 350 independent simulated events (collisions). Where each event contains approximately 3,000 labeled images of different particle trajectories passing through many detectors resulting from the collision. The events were simulated with [ACTS in the context of the TRACKML challenge](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01745714/document) and were modified to target not particle tracking but rather particle identification.

If you are curious to learn about the original format of the dataset (which has also geometry and clusters information), checkout the dataset description and files here (you have to sign in) : https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20112#participate-get-data

This is the multiclass classification computer vision problem to identify particles by five types, labeled as follows:

- 11: "electron"
- 13: "muon"
- 211: "pion"
- 321: "kaon"
- 2212: "proton"

__Files available :__

- __The training data__ consists of 350 .pkl files, each representing a unique event (or collision). Each .pkl file contains two columns: Column 1 is a list of 10x10 images. Column 2 is the particle type associated to the image (int). Training data can be downloaded at: https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/OH9tOo8VHYpHJDl. This data is open-source data.
- __SampleSubmission.csv__ - is an example of what your submission file should look like.
- __Data_test_file.pkl__ is the test set which contains about 4,000 images of particles (not associated with any specific event)
- __cirtaChallenge.ipynb__: is a starter python notebook. It shows you how to open and view a .pkl file and starts you off with a simple classifier.


__Note that the training set is highly imbalanced, but the test set has been designed to be balanced.__

# First insight


```python
#Import libraries to load and process data
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

import pickle
import glob
import random
import os

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

This dictionnary will be usefull later when we'll need to have the meaning of each class and to know what it corresponds to.

```python
# code to particle name dictionary : 
dic_types = {11: "electron", 13: "muon", 211: "pion", 321: "kaon", 2212: "proton"}
```

Let's load only one of the binary file of the data set and see the shape :

```python
# load a pickle file
event = pickle.load(open('../../Desktop/particle_train_data/event1.pkl', 'rb'))

# get the data and target
data, target = event[0], event[1]
target = target.astype('int')
event.shape, data.shape, target.shape, data[0].shape, target[0].shape
```

((2, 3598), (3598,), (3598,), (10, 10), ())


```python
data[3597]
```
    array([[2., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 3., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 2., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1.]])

```python
target[3597]
```
2212

```python
target.dtype, data.dtype
```

(dtype('int32'), dtype('O'))

```python
target[0].dtype, data[0].dtype
```

(dtype('int32'), dtype('float64'))


__Distribution of particles in an event__
We can immediately see that the target in highly imbalanced and multiclass :

```python
from collections import Counter

plt.bar(range(len(dic_types)),list(Counter(target).values()))
plt.xticks(range(len(dic_types)), [dic_types[i] for i in list(Counter(target).keys())])
plt.show()
```

![png](/images/2020-02-15-Particles/output_12_0.png)

Displays 10 randomly choosen images for each collision, in order to see if there is a common pattern in each class (which is not obvious at first sight)

```python
for j in [11, 13, 211, 321, 2212]:
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
    data_tmp = data[np.where(target==j)]
    for i in range(1, 6):
        plt.subplot(1, 5, i)
        num = random.randint(0, data_tmp.shape[0]-1)
        plt.axis('off')
        plt.title(dic_types[j])
        plt.imshow(data_tmp[num])
    plt.show()
```

# Data Preparation

At first, let's load all the data, then we have to check if all the chunks have the same shape. The second step consists in transforming all pickles files into two numpy arrays (data & target)


```python
pkls = glob.glob('../../Desktop/particle_train_data/*.pkl')


def check_consistency():
    """Check consistency of types and shapes of the data"""
    for pk in pkls:
        event = pickle.load(open(pk, 'rb'))
        if event.shape[0] != 2:
            print("shape different for :", pk[39:-4], event.shape)
        data, target = event[0], event[1]
        target = target.astype('int')
        if data.shape != target.shape:
            print("inconsistent shapes between data & target for ", pk[39:-4], data.shape, event.shape)
        i = 0
        for d, t in zip(data, target):
            if d.dtype != 'float64' or t.dtype != 'int64':
                print("pb of type", i)
            if d.shape != (10, 10) or t.shape != ():
                print("pb of size")
            i += 1
            

def seperate_d_t(pkl):
    "load the pickle file & return flatten data & target"
    event = pickle.load(open('../../Desktop/particle_train_data/event1.pkl', 'rb'))
    data, target = event[0], event[1].astype('int')
    data = np.array([d.reshape(100) for d in data])
    return data, target


def prepare_data():
    """Merge all the pickle files"""
    # initialize the first element
    data, target = seperate_d_t('../../Desktop/particle_train_data/event1.pkl')


    # loop to concatenate the 1st with all other elts
    pkls.remove('../../Desktop/particle_train_data/event1.pkl')
    for pk in pkls:
        try:
            data_tmp, target_tmp = seperate_d_t(pk)
            data, target = np.concatenate((data, data_tmp), axis=0), np.concatenate((target, target_tmp), axis=0)
        except:
            print("pb for pk: ", pkpk[39:-4])
    return data, target

if os.path.isfile(X_path) and os.path.isfile(y_path):
    data = np.array(pd.read_csv(X_path))
    target = np.array(pd.read_csv(y_path))
else :
    check_consistency()
    data, target = prepare_data()
    pd.DataFrame(data).to_csv(X_path, index=False)
    pd.DataFrame(target).to_csv(y_path, index=False)

 array([  3150,    700, 981050, 160300, 114100], dtype=int64))

Let's compute the ratio of the least represented class :

```python
print('ratio:', np.unique(target, return_counts=True)[1][1] / np.unique(target, return_counts=True)[1][3] * 100, '%')
```

 ratio: 0.43668122270742354 %

# Basic Machine Learning Models & Predictions

Now let's use the most common and simple machine learning models in order to get a base line. As always, we need to preprocess and split our data set into a training & test parts. 

__Side note__ : it is important here to use the stratify parameter so that the proportion of values in the sample produced in our test group will be the same as the proportion of values provided to parameter stratify. This results especially useful when working around classification problems, since if we don’t provide this parameter with an array-like object, we may end with a non-representative distribution of our target classes in our test group.
Furthermore, there is a class with very few records, without the stratify parameter we may have a training or a test data set without muon !


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# preprocess dataset, split into training and test part
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, target, test_size=0.20, random_state=42, stratify=target)
X_train.shape, X_test.shape, y_train.shape, y_test.shape

# Using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique

How SMOTe works
Brief description on SMOTe (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):

it creates synthetic observations of the minority class (bad loans) by:

Finding the k-nearest-neighbors for minority class observations (finding similar observations)
Randomly choosing one of the k-nearest-neighbors and using it to create a similar, but randomly tweaked, new observation.
More explanations can be found here

An other informative article

Oversampling is a well-known way to potentially improve models trained on imbalanced data. But it’s important to remember that oversampling incorrectly can lead to thinking a model will generalize better than it actually does. Random forests are great because the model architecture reduces overfitting (see Brieman 2001 for a proof), but poor sampling practices can still lead to false conclusions about the quality of a model.

When the model is in production, it’s predicting on unseen data. The main point of model validation is to estimate how the model will generalize to new data. If the decision to put a model into production is based on how it performs on a validation set, it’s critical that oversampling is done correctly.
